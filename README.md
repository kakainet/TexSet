# TexSet
## Generate own dataset
### Preparation
- Modify `config/job.json`

```
{
    "max-depth": 4, # max depth of elements
    "parts": 4, # number of threads
    "samples-in-part": 10, # number of elements generated by a one thread without level augmentation
    "level-augmentation": true, # do the same job for depth = 0, 1, 2, ..., max-depth - 1 - each job with next thread
    "deeper-chance": 1 # chance that recursion of a generating tree will go deeper, but bounded by max-depth
}
```
- Modify `config/aug_job.json` if you need augmentation
```
{
    "threads": 12,
    "samples-lvl-percent": { # how many % of samples from given level will be augmented
        "1": 0.2,
        "2": 0.1,
        "3": 0.05
    }
}
```

- Modify `config/rescale.json`

```
{
    "1": 0.5, # Expression with depth 1 will be treated as they were 50% of the original size.
    "2": 0.35, # Expression with depth 2 will be treated as they were 35% of the orginal size.
    "3": 0.2, # ...
    "4": 0.15 # leafs as they were 15% of the orginal size.
}
```
### Generate step

```
python3 toolkit/generate_dataset.py --job config/job.json --aug-job config/aug_job.json 
```

WARNING: `parts * ([level-augmentation ? (max-depth)! : 1])` threads will be created.
